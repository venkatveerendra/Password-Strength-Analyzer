## 💻 Usage

### Basic Implementation
Use the following code snippet to analyze password strength programmatically:
```python
from password_analyzer import PasswordStrengthAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = PasswordStrengthAnalyzer()

# Analyze password
result = analyzer.analyze_password("YourPassword123!")

# Get results
print(f"Strength Score: {result['score']}/100")
print(f"Feedback: {result['feedback']}")
```

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Analyze a password directly from the command line:
```bash
python password_analyzer.py --password "YourPassword123!"
```

## 📊 Scoring Criteria

| Criterion       | Points | Description                           |
|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| **Length**      | 20     | Minimum 8 characters                 |
| **Complexity**  | 30     | Mix of character types               |
| **Patterns**    | 25     | Absence of common patterns           |
| **Dictionary**  | 25     | Resistance to dictionary attacks     |

### Score Interpretation
- 🔴 **0-20**: Very Weak
- 🟠 **21-40**: Weak
- 🟡 **41-60**: Moderate
- 🟢 **61-80**: Strong
- 🔵 **81-100**: Very Strong
